# GPA-Predictor
GPA prediction using regression in KNIME platform.

This analysis explores the relationship between SAT scores and college GPAs using a sample dataset of 100 students. The objective is to develop and evaluate a predictive model using linear regression to determine if SAT scores can reliably predict college GPAs. The study employs statistical methods such as mean, standard deviation, t-tests, Pearson correlation, and regression analysis, conducted at a 5% significance level. The analysis is carried out using the KNIME Analytics Platform, a tool that facilitates data integration, analysis, and visualization without coding. Initial findings show a moderate positive correlation between SAT scores and GPA (correlation coefficient of 0.637), indicating that higher SAT scores tend to correspond to higher GPAs. However, the p-value analysis suggests that this correlation is not statistically significant enough to robustly predict GPA outcomes.

The study highlights concerns about the reliability of using SAT scores as a predictor of college success, consistent with previous research that questions the validity of SAT scores across different populations. The predictive model generated through KNIME showed limitations, with the correlation not being strong or consistent enough to serve as a definitive predictive tool. Outliers in the data suggest that other factors may influence GPA, and future studies could benefit from incorporating additional variables to improve model accuracy. The study acknowledges that while SAT scores provide some insight, they are not a sole determinant of academic achievement, and the need for a more nuanced approach in predictive modeling is emphasized.
